HaskellTO Projects
========

This is the project repository of the Toronto Haskell User Group. We'll use it to coordinate our efforts on group projects, post interesting code snippets and share presentations with each other.

If you're interested in joining the group our mailing list is here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/toronto-haskell

We usually meet the third Wednesday of each month. Upcoming meetings are announced on the mailing list and also in the weekly events email of our host Bento Miso.
